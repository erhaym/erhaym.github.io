Hello, I'm Aymen. I'm an international student passionate about everything related to cybersecurity and software.

Here I will write about my learning journey, whether it be writeups, projects or articles.

I am particularily interested in web security and pwn (binary exploitation).

In my spare time, I tackle online challenges and gain knowledge from resources on platforms like [Root-Me](https://www.root-me.org/imvindex) and [pwn.college](https://pwn.college/hacker/97990). (Click to access my accounts)

Feel free to contact me at [erraihani@proton.me](mailto:erraihani@proton.me) anytime, for any queries.
